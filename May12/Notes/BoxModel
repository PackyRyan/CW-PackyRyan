Padding: Pushes content away from walls
Border: the Walls
Margin: The outer layer

Padding or Margin?

Are you moving the content or the whole box?

To move content, use PADDING
(creating space around the content)
(by default, padding shows the background)
(internal)

To move content/an element away from another element, use MARGIN
(more layout focused)
(how elements interact w eachother)
(pushes elements away)
(external)

*Don't think of Microsoft Word language, where Margin means how wide is the text, in html, that is Padding.*

Height & Width affect CONTENT

Box Sizing - what method should the browser use to read this
ex. box-sizing: border-box;
                content-box;
                
Margin cont.
TRBL

1)  auto - use it simultaneously on Left and Right, it centers your element (if there is room to center)

ex.

.black { width: 80%;
         margin: auto;
         or
         margin: 20px; 10%;

2) Margin Collapse
    (for vertical margins. when 2 vertical margins collide, the smaller of the two goes away)
         
         
         THIS WEEK:  FLOAT (float property, clear property)
                     DISPLAY (inline: block)
                     POSITION
                     

         )

FLOW

Normal) The order in which the browser encounters your elements, will be the order in which it loads and renders them

--

FLOAT

float: none|left|right
  
1) Renders the element in normal flow
    -things that come before our floating element, are still going to appear above the floating element
    
2) Shifts the element as far left|right as possible...within its container

3) If this is 'big picture' layout (columns etc), specify a width (especially with block elements)

4) Other elements (that come afterwords in normal flow) will "flow" up and around it.

5) Margin is your friend.  Useful to control the empty space.

CLEAR

clear: none|left|right|both|
"Stops bubbling without making you float"

.clear-right {clear: right;}

Can only be applied to Block Elements

ex.

<p>1</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>3</p>

p {

    float: right;}
    
    }
    
This comes out to be 3_2_1 in a page, reversing the order from the right


---

Overflow

overflow: auto;
