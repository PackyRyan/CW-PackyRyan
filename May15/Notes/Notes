position: fixed;

1)Remove from normal flow
1a) Use margi or padding as necessary

2)When user scrolls, the element stays put and does not scroll with page

Offsets
-dictate the elements position from the side specified-

top: dimenion; (px or %)

fixed offset: the distance from the edge of the screen

Typically we specify two offsets, to create a fixed X,Y position (vert/horiz)

ex.

position: fixed;
top: 0;
left: 0;
width: set this whenever you specify Fix and Offset
positioned at the top left corner of the page, no pixels of space

position: fixed;
top: 0;
bottom: 0;
right: 0;
left: 0;

]takes up the whole page fully

position: fixed;
top: 0;
right: 0;
left: 0;

]used for headers

----------
position: relative
----------

1) Remain in the normal flow
2) Offsets refer to where the element would be in its natural flow



-----
z-index
-----

1) Only affects non-static elements
2) Default is 0
3) Takes unitless integers as values (-9999999 to 9999999)

------------------
position: absolute
------------------

1) Removes from normal flow (like fixed, stays put w/o offsets)
2) Offset Coordinates is based off of first (closest) non-static parent.
    a) If there is no non-static parent, then it is based off the <body>.  aka  identical to fixed.
3) Set a width
